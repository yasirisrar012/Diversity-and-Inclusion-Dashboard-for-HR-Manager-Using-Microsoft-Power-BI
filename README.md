The diversity and inclusion dataset is provided in .xlsx format by the client who is a HR Manager from a big telecom company. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. The task was to define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, turnover and create a visualization in the form of Power BI dashboard to understand root causes of their slow progress.
Approach-
1) Raw data collection in data in .xlsx format
2) Feature engineering by adding new measures using DAX formulas
3) Data visualization using visuals and KPIs.

This project basically includes 2 dashboards as mentioned-
1) Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard-1- which includes:
a. Hiring for different positions by gender
b. Promotions (This Year)
c. Turnover Rate (FY20 Leavers)
2) Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard-2- which includes:
a. Performance Rating
b. Executive Gender Balance
c. Age Group of Employees at different positions.

The following measures helped to define proper KPIs-
1) Number of men
2) Number of women
3) Number of leavers
4) % employees promoted (FY21)
5) % of women promoted
6) % of hires men
7) % of hires women
8) % turnover 
9) Average performance rating: men
10) Average Performance rating: women
